All notable changes to hexplorer are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- `hexplorer storage config default_language=<gleam|elixir|erlang|all>` to persist startup language.
- `?` settings screen now includes a `default_language` row and `color_scheme` row with `←`/`→` to cycle values.
- `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+Backspace` now delete the previous word in search mode and in the GitHub token input field.
- Detail view: `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycle a cursor through the available links (docs, hex.pm, repo). `Enter` opens the selected link in the system browser.
- Detail view: `r` force-refreshes GitHub stats and version history for the currently selected package only (evicts its entry from both the GH stats cache and the in-memory listing cache).
- Settings screen: new `link_style` row (under Appearance) cycles between `Cursor ▶` (vim-like marker) and `Block ■` (solid accent-color background on the selected link row). Setting persists to `meta.json`.
- Header now shows a colored cache-status badge: `● live` (green) after a fresh network fetch, `◎ cached` (yellow) when results are served from the in-memory session cache, and `⟳ fetching…` (dim) while a request is in flight.
- In-memory session cache (`pkg_cache`) stores listing results keyed by `(query, sort, language, page)` — repeated navigation to the same view is instant and avoids redundant HTTP requests.

### Changed
- `hexplorer` now loads `default_language` from `~/.cache/hexplorer/meta.json` when `--lang` is not explicitly passed.
- UI now persistently loads selected color scheme from storage meta.

### Fixed

- `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+Backspace` had no effect in search mode (issue #3).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-02

### Changed
- README URLs and installation examples updated to use `lupodevelop` and current commit-based raw asset paths.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- `ptr_arg`: `sort_packages` now accepts `&mut [Package]` instead of `&mut Vec<Package>`
- `manual_flatten`: replaced `if let Ok(pkgs)` in the loop with `.into_iter().flatten()`
- `derivable_impls`: manual `impl Default for Args` replaced with `#[derive(Default)]`
- `manual_split_once`: three occurrences of `splitn(2, '_').nth(1)` replaced with `split_once`
- `print_literal`: en-dash `–` inlined in `println!` format string
- `match_result_ok`: `if let Some(x) = y.ok()` replaced with `if let Ok(x) = y`


## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- Interactive TUI for browsing HEX.pm packages (Gleam, Elixir, Erlang, All BEAM tabs)
- Full-text search across name + description, filtered by ecosystem
- Detail view with GitHub stars, forks, open issues (live fetch + 6h disk cache)
- Non-TUI output modes: `--output json`, `--output compact`, `--output detail <name>`
- Snapshot storage under `~/.cache/hexplorer/` with configurable retention (`storage` subcommand)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` support to raise API rate limit from 60 to 5 000 req/h

### Technical
- Language-specific search fetches up to 5 pages in parallel (~500 packages) for full-ecosystem coverage
- All BEAM mode fetches Gleam + Elixir + Erlang concurrently, merges and assigns correct language badges client-side
- Fetch generation counter prevents stale results from overwriting newer fetches
- 10s HTTP timeout on all requests
